%% 1. CONNECT TO YOUR NANOBOT
%  Remember to replace the first input argument with text corresponding to
%  the correct serial port you found through the Arduino IDE or 
%  port_detector.m. Note that the clc and clear all will clear your 
%  command window and all saved variables!

clear; clc; close all; % initialization
nb = nanobot('COM7', 115200, 'serial'); 
nb.ledWrite(0); % make sure the LED is off

%% 2. COLLECT AND STUDY SOME ACCELEROMETER DATA 
% This section of the code enables accelerometer streaming and then 
% collects a 1.5-second segment of data.  Run this section several times to
% get a feel for what the accelerometer data looks like for different
% gestured numbers.  Each time you run the code a new figure with your 
% data will appear.  Start by gesturing "1" and "0", but feel free to try 
% additional gestures! You can add "close all" here if you ever want to
% close all of the figures (alternatively, run the next section of 
% code).

% For all of these intel labs, you can hold the dowel however you want.  
% However, you should try to be consistent in how you hold it from one lab 
% to the next.


% countdown is defined in a separate file in the nanobot_matlab folder

numreads = 150; % about 2 seconds (on serial); adjust as needed, but we 
                % will be using a value of 150 for Labs 4 and 5

% Run this section of code whenever you want to close all of the figures 
% at once.

%% 3. DETERMINE THE GESTURE FOR THE ACCELEROMETER TRACE 
% In this part of the code you will make one gesture, classify it, and 
% plot the results.

countdown("Beginning in", 3); %display a countdown to prep user to move accelerometer 

nb.ledWrite(1); %Turn on the LED to signify start of recording
disp("Make A Gesture!"); %prompt user to make a movement

numreads = 150; % about 2 seconds (on serial); adjust as needed, but we 
                % will be using a value of 150 for Labs 4 and 5
vals = zeros(3,numreads);
for i = 1:numreads
    val = nb.accelRead();
    vals(1,i) = val.x;
    vals(2,i) = val.y;
    vals(3,i) = val.z;

% Below, you need to write your own code to use the 3-axis (x,y,z)
% accelerometer data to determine what number the user gestured. 
% At a minimum, you need to write code capable of determining if the user 
% gestures a ZERO or a ONE. Currently, the code just randomly sets the 
% variable "label" to ONE or ZERO. You should write code to automatically 
% set the variable "label" to ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, 
% SEVEN, EIGHT, or NINE. Start with differentiating between ZERO and ONE. 
% Then try to incoprorate TWO. Then add THREE, then FOUR, etc.
z_max = max(vals(3,:));
z_min = min(vals(3,:));
range_z = z_max - z_min;

y_max = max(vals(2,:));
y_min = min(vals(2,:));
range_y = y_max - y_min;

fprintf("range z %d",range_z);
fprintf("range y %d",range_y);

%%%%%%%%%%%%% DETERMINE WHICH GESTURE (YOUR CODE GOES HERE) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        
if abs(range_z - range_y) < .25 % REPLACE THIS (rand(1) creates a random number as a 
                % placeholder so the code will compile; replace the 
                % comparison with 0.5 with something better)

%% X. DISCONNECT
%  Clears the workspace and command window, then
